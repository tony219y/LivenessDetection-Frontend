# Liveness Detection Project

## Overview

The **Liveness Detection Project** aims to improve facial recognition systems by enabling them to distinguish between real faces and spoofing attempts (such as photos or videos used to deceive the system). This project focuses on implementing liveness detection to enhance the security and reliability of facial recognition systems.

## Features

- **Liveness Detection**: Detects whether the face is real or a spoof (such as a photo or video).
- **NUAA Imposter Database**: The project utilizes the **NUAA Imposter Database** to train and test the model, improving its accuracy in detecting spoofing attempts.
- **Model Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 99.8%
  - Precision: 99.7%
  - Recall: 99.9%
  - F1 Score: 99.8%
  - APCER: 0.004%
  - BPCER: 0.0006%

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: We started with our own dataset but switched to the **NUAA Imposter Database** for better diversity and accuracy.
- **GPU Setup**: The training process was initially slow using a regular PC, but we upgraded to a high-performance GPU, which significantly sped up the training time.
